## Description

The **navigation** helsps to choose section you need.

The **first section** of homepage represents my date of birth and my place of residence. I'm talking about what do I do in my life on ongoing basis. I tell anout my interests and languages I speak.

There is a simple **example table** with my favourite pieces of music in the second section. I made it with usage of CSS and HTML.
In the third section I left some useful links and my contact details.

There's **example button** programmed in Java Script that toggles background.

On **console** you can see welkome message, which greets developers that look in there.
